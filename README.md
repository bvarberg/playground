// role_performs_some_action.spec.ts
// a new file for every feature

// feature: the job story as code
// reflects the filename + feature focus

  // scenario: one potential outcome for the feature
  specify("they see the some view", () => {});
  specify("using the textbox to enter their value", () => {});
